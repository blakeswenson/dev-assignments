## Title: Condominium Investment - Return on Investment (ROI) Calculator
## Developer: Blake Swenson
## Date: 3/23/2021
## Purpose: This application calculates ROI on a condominium purchase over the life of the investment.

def calculate_total_investment(purchase_price, annual_property_taxes, monthly_condo_fees, number_of_years):
    return (purchase_price + (annual_property_taxes * number_of_years) + (monthly_condo_fees * 12 * number_of_years))
    ## The investment cost adds condominium purchase price, total annual taxes over the life of the investment and the total monthly fees paid over the life of the investment.

def calculate_sale_price(purchase_price, appreciation_rate, number_of_years):
    sale_price = purchase_price
    for year in range(number_of_years):
        sale_price = sale_price * (1 + (appreciation_rate / 100))
    return sale_price
    ## Expected sale price is calculated by a function appreciating each year over the life of the investment the purchase price at the % rate provided using a loop.

def calculate_roi(total_investment, sale_price, purchase_price):
    investment_profit = sale_price - total_investment
    ## Investment profit is calculated as expected sale price â€“ total investment cost. 
    return_on_investment = (investment_profit / purchase_price) * 100
    return return_on_investment
    ## ROI is calculated as Investment profit/Purchase price * 100
